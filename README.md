# Gilded Rose starting position in Java

## Introduction

- We expect a link to a repository (Github, bitbucket, gitlab) that we can access containing your source code. Please commit regularly so we can follow your thinking process.
- We expect to have a README.md that explains how to compile and run this code.
- We expect you to produce the best code you can possibly provide to us, and that you are able to explain the choices you made.
- We expect you to spend around 4 hours on this exercise, however having a working software is more important than the time spent on it.
